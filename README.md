ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation System
This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to recommend the most suitable crop to grow based on real-time soil and climate conditions. It uses a neural network model trained on agricultural data and provides an intuitive user interface using Streamlit
Features
Predicts the best crop based on:

Soil nutrient values: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)

Soil pH level

Temperature (Â°C)

Humidity (%)

Rainfall (mm)

Displays model prediction confidence

User-friendly web interface with responsive design

Pre-trained model included for fast prediction without retraining
